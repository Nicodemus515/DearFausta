		Dear Fausta,</br></br>
This is a heart I made for you using pure HTML and CSS.</br> 
Now, I'm sure you don't know what that means, so let me explain.</br>
Well to start I'm using my own web server to host this website,</br>
because that's pretty much what this is. A website. I wanted this</br>
website to symbolize a few things. First, just like the continuous</br>
beating heart on this page, my heart belongs to you and this heart</br>
will only stop beating from the moment my heart stops. Second, just</br>
like how my hard drive will always have space for this heart and this</br>
website, there will always be space for you in my heart. Let this be</br>
a reminder of those things.</br></br>
Love,</br>
Nick
